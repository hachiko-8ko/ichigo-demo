        <h1>Promises and Event Handlers</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Promises are the basic unit of asynchronous programming in the Web. Promises are tasks, and they have two basic
            fundamental properties: they start when you create them and they execute only once. These two points are fine
            for doing this like doing a fetch() over ajax, but they drastically reduce the utility for certain types of
            task-based programming. So I created two new classes to handle these cases, but keeping the same API (except
            for the deletion of the troublesome onrejected method): the deferred and the repeatable promise.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            The deferred promise is a wrapper around a regular javascript promise that allows it to be triggered manually at any point
            after it's creation. Create a deferred promise using
            <code>const deferred = new DeferredPromise().then(t => something(t)).catch(c => otherthing(c))</code> and then, when you want to call it, call
            <code>deferred.resolve('some data')</code> (or <code>reject()</code>).
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            The repeatable promise is really only a promise factory having the promise API. When you resolve or reject the repeatable promise,
            it creates a new promise according to your configured tasks and resolves or rejects it. This makes it suitable
            as an event emitter, which ordinary promises are not, because of the resolve once behavior.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            The onrejected() method is deleted because it only creates bugs. If you use onfulfilled() and onrejected(), if you were inexperienced
            you might think that errors in onfulfilled() would bounce to onrejected(). You would be wrong. Experienced JS
            programmers recommend not using onrejected(). Just use catch() like everyone else.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Deferred promises can be awaited by accessing the .output property, which exposes the internal promise. Repeatable
            promises cannot be awaited, because await implies a single run through of the code. However, if you build a single
            promise using build() (repeatables are just factories), you can await the result.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Promises are very similar to events, but not entirely useful because of the "run once right now" behavior. But once this is 
            resolved, you get a very nice API for configuring repeated events, and this brings us to the EventHandler. You create an event emitter,
            subscribe one or more delegates (methods) to it using the promise API, and when the event emitter is invoked,
            those delegates are executed. This is called an EventHandler (even though it is an emitter) because when I was looking for an
            alternative to the nightmare caused by using custom browser events, I stole an idea from C#, and that's what they call it there.

                                                You create a deferred promise by calling new DeferredPromise(). Both inputs are optional. Just like with a normal promise,
                                                you can pass an onfulfilled function, which is the same as calling then()
                                                on the promise. Unlike a normal promise, you cannot pass an onrejected function,
                                                because this can lead to errors (exceptions in this method are not caught).
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                If you like, you can set throwOnUnhandledError to true. This automatically adds a catch() after every then() and catch()
                                                that throws a new error.
                                            </p>

                                                you want to resolve the deferred promise and await it, you need to access
                                                the actual promise, not a wrapper object. By awaiting myDeferredPromise.output,
                                                the browser is satisfied, invokes the promise, and waits for the output.

                                            You create a repeatable promise by calling new RepeatablePromise(). All inputs are optional. Just like with a normal promise,
                                            you can pass an onfulfilled function, which is the same as calling then() on
                                            the promise. Unlike a normal promise, you cannot pass an onrejected function,
                                            because this can lead to errors (exceptions in this method are not caught).
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            If you like, you can pass a default error handler, which adds a catch() to the very end of the callback chain.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Also if you like, you can set throwOnUnhandledError to true. This automatically adds a catch() at the very end (even after
                                            onUnhandledError) that throws a new error.
                                        </p>

                                                onrejected is omitted. Otherwise, this is the same as Promise (it's just

                                                Builds and returns a new deferred promise, using the current callback chain on the repeatable.

                                                This can be awaited as in the following example:
                                                <code>await promise.build().output;</code>. This builds a single instance (you can't await multiple) and awaits it.
                                                I don't think it very likely that anyone will really need this, but it's
                                                just a side effect of the factory process.

                                                I considered, for the sake of consistency, making an output field that returned the output of a built instance, but it seemed
                                                silly. I may change my mind, as it's a few minutes work.

                                                Creates a new EventHandler. By default, callbacks are called using Promises (actually DeferredPromises) on the microtask
                                                queue, but if you set disableAsync to true, they'll be called synchronously.
                                                This makes it a lot easier to step through code in developer tools, but browsers
                                                really work better using asynchronous events.
