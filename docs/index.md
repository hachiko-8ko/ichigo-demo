# Ichigo Demo Pages

<img src="img/ichigo-logo-small.gif" alt="Ichigo">

This is a page dedicated to showing how you could use Ichigo, the HTML5 Typescript/Javascript micro-framework.
Ichigo is something I wrote for fun, so it's probably not the most powerful, most amazing framework. But it _is_
small. Under 60K for the entire thing, less if you only need a few parts.

Does small mean a lot in a world where every web page has several MB of scripts to download? Probably not. But I
think it's neat that it's now possible to build a modern dynamic web application with very little code and the
help of a tiny library. That tiny library only wraps standard ES 2015 functions in a friendly API, but a nice
API goes a long way toward making programming simple.

## Demos

I'll add demo pages as I think of some and feel like making them. There'll only be some simple ones to start.
It takes a while think of good examples, and this is only something I do to kill time and making demos is not even
remotely exciting.

* [Unit Test Bench](test-bench): Basic unit tests
* [Hello World](hello-world): Every programming demo has to start with Hello World, by law
* [Simple Counter](simple-counter): A simple counter using one-way binding and prototype extensions
