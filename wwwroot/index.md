# Ichigo Demo Page

This is a page dedicated to showing how you could use Ichigo, the HTML5 Typescript/Javascript micro-framework.

Right now, I don't know if this works. Github won't let me test it until after I've made it public.
When I do that, I probably won't jump in right away if it works, but wait until I have more content.

## Demos

Right now, all I have is the unit test page, until I spend the time to come up with some other example pages.
